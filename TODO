Neat future features:

 * Always show your comments, perhaps highlighted with a new color
 * Hilight comments mentioning your LWN username
 * Always show comments from your friends (AKA “whitelist”)
 * Keep a list of well-known developers and their user names, so their
   comments will be hilighted.
 * Keep a general username-to-website mapping which people can submit. When
   an article loads, the mapping loads via AJAX and links all registered
   usernames to their web sites.
