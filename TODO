Bugs
====

 * A "mark all read" button at the bottom too
 * Swap position of mark read / mark unread buttons so it's easier to
   find the mark read button

Features
========

 * Always show your comments, perhaps highlighted with a new color
 * Optional auto-mark-read whenever you load a page.
 * Change "Comments: XX" to "Comments: XX (YY unread)" on the front page,
   weekly edition, etc.
 * Always show comments from your friends (AKA “whitelist”)
 * Keep a list of well-known developers and their user names, so their
   comments will be hilighted.
 * Keep a general username-to-website mapping which people can submit. When
   an article loads, the mapping loads via AJAX and links all registered
   usernames to their web sites.
 * Talkinator support.  Add in the sidebar:
   <iframe width=250 height=400 marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 scrolling=no
   style='border: 1px solid #819dd4' frameborder=0
   src='http://t8rd.info/$r?s=0&t=h&w=250&h=400&c=ffcc99&b=LWN&u=USER'>
   </iframe>

   But set the "USER" part to the LWN user's username.
