 * A "mark all read" button at the bottom too

Features
========

 * Always show your comments, perhaps highlighted with a new color
 * Optional auto-mark-read whenever you load a page.
 * Change "Comments: XX" to "Comments: XX (YY unread)" on the front page,
   weekly edition, etc.
 * Always show comments from your friends (AKA “whitelist”)
 * Keep a list of well-known developers and their user names, so their
   comments will be hilighted.
 * Keep a general username-to-website mapping which people can submit. When
   an article loads, the mapping loads via AJAX and links all registered
   usernames to their web sites.
